For CprE 186, we picked teams and worked on a semester project. I worked with two great coders on a video game involving the Leap Motion. 

The main goal of the project was to gain experience in the field of statically and dynamically linked libraries. We divided our project into 3 "engines" - Graphics, Physics, and Leap Motion Input. We each took on one of the three modules, then brought them together with one static library to load them at runtime. 

The result was a modular design that we used to abstract away low level graphics, physics, and input calls away from the high level game. With that, we were able to make a golf like physics game atop our custom game engine. 

Our team name was "RDFT" so our engine was appropriately named "The RDFT Engine."
