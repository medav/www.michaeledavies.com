This past semester I started working on my senior design project, acting as my group's **webmaster**.

The goal of the project is to design and implement a framework for developing collaboration tools for multi-actor scenarios with Microsoft HoloLens. So far, our groups has dove into the project and learned about coordinate space sharing, HoloLens gestures, manipulating 3D models in Unity and much more.

This project will help a wide range of professions to communicate 3-Dimensional ideas to one another, such as in describing a new overpass to be installed on a highway, or building plans.
