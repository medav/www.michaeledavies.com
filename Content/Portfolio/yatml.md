**yatml** is a guide I wrote to help students at an undergraduate level in computer sciences and engineering to learn the fundemental mathematics of modern machine learning - specifically neural networks. In addition, the guide shows several examples of how to then apply these fundementals with TensorFlow and Keras. Click the link (above) to view the github page. You can also view the slides directly [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AhBV_pq3X7p3gs9uS6ygLdc01QTVFA).
