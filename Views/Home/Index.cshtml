### Obligatory Elevator Speech

> I am a **Computer Engineer**, and **Mathematician**. I love programming and building things. I love to tinker and learn how all sorts of things work. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences Department and plan to pursue a Ph.D. <br><br>
> Professionally, I have had the wonderful opportunity to work for **Rockwell Collins**, at **Iowa State University** as a undergraduate research assistant, **Microsoft** as software intern for several summers, and **SimpleMachines Inc.** as a hardware engineer. <br><br>
> Personally, I am most curious about the low-level workings of a computer - **Hardware**, and **Operating Systems**. Don't let that fool you though - I love to learn about the whole technology spectrum: from electrons to computational theory.
