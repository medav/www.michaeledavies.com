### Obligatory Elevator Speech

> I am a **Computer Engineer**, and **Mathematician**. I love programming and building things. I love to tinker and learn how all sorts of things work. Currently I am a senior at Iowa State University, and plan to attend graduate school to pursue a PhD after I finish my undergraduate degree. <br>
> Professionally, I have had the wonderful opportunity to work for **Rockwell Collins** as a technical intern, at **Iowa State University** as a undergraduate research assistant, and **Microsoft** for the past three summers as a software development engineering intern. <br>
> Personally, I am most curious about the low-level workings of a computer - **Hardware**, and **Operating Systems**. I also am learning about **machine learning** and **data science**. Don't let that fool you though - I love to learn about the whole technology spectrum: from electrons to computational theory.
