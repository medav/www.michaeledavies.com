For the last few months I worked with my research group at Iowa State (CoMFRe) to develop some cool new stuff. After our papers are published I will link them here. For now, though, you can see the code I wrote [here](https://bitbucket.org/baskargroup/flowsculptga).

This is all based on Lab-On-A-Chip stuff. Since the project is quite complicated I will not be describing it here. Instead, please see the above mentioned papers (when they are released).
