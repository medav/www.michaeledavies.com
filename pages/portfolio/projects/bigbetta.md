During the Spring 2015 HackISU, I worked with Gabby Ortman, Thomas Moll, and Paul Schlenker on an ambitious project involving machine learning. We discussed how we had accumulated over 8000 images of Gabby's Betta fish, Watson, and decided to build an image classifier using a convlutional neural network that we named FishNet. The network was based on LeNet for digit classification, but we trained the model instead to detect if a Betta fish was in the picture. 

The result was a website that was able to take a photo of a fish tank every 10 minutes, then predict whether the fish was in the photo, and caption the image accordingly. Our team placed 1st in software for HackISU Spring 2015.
