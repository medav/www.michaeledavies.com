In my senior year at Iowa State, a partner and I designed and implemented an accelerator for computing Conway's Game of Life that would run on a ZedBoard Zynq SoC. Our accelerator is written in Verilog and synthesizes to the programmable logic portion of the SoC. We then leveraged Xilinxâ€™s AXI-DMA module to stream the game to the accelerator for computation. Our design is parameterized, allowing our accelerator to scale to any available logic size. In addition, computation lanes share game states, enabling the accelerator to have nearly 1 access per unit cell.
