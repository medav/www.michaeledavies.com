During my time in Dr. Baskarâ€™s computational mechanics group, I worked on a project aimed towards enabling automated design of micropillar sequences for lab-on-a-chip applications. The project resulted in an open source application allowing users to graphically enter a desired flow pattern and compute a sequence of micropillar obstructions to achieve that pattern. We leveraged genetic algorithm optimization as a method to compute optimal pillar sequences. This work resulted in multiple research papers.
