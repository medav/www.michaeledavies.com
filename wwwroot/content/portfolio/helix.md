During the first semester of my junior year, I worked with 3 friends of mine, Thomas Moll, Kris Burney, and Kyle Fischer. We worked on a semester long project involving the use of a webapp and REST Api backend paired with a frontend mobile app with the purpose of gathering user votes to help drive the systematic design of graphical objects. 

The idea is that a graphic designer would come up with a product they want to design. They would define, in general terms, how this product should look. The designed would define what attributes are free to be modified and a template would be created and the project would be available to vote on. Users with the Helix mobile app would then vote on their favorite variations of the product, driving the fitness function of a backend genetic algorithm to optimize parameters. 

The end result is the optimal set of varied parameters presented to the original designed to incorporate to their product so as to maximize customer satisfaction.
