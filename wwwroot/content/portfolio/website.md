There have many iterations of my personal website over the years, but I finally built something worth mentioning. The website you are viewing now was written with **Node.js** as a backend, using **marked** for compiling markdown content into html, and **Liquid Node** as a templating engine. The pages are broken into modules, each having the ability to be a static web page or define custom routes to provide custom functionality (E.g. See my blog [here](/bits)).
