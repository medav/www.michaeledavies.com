There have many iterations of my personal website over the years, but I finally built something worth mentioning. The website you are viewing now was written with **asp.net core 2.0** as a backend, using **Markdown** compiled into HTML content, and **Razer C#** as a templating engine. 

You can see all the source code for my website [here](https://github.com/medav/www.michaeledavies.com).
